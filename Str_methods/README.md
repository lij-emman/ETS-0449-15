# CAPITALISE STRING METHOD

 is used to convert the first letter of a string to uppercase while making all other letters lowercase. 




# CASEFOLD STRING SYSTEM
 
It is used in Python to convert a string to lowercase. I will try to show in this file how it relates with other string method called "lower"

## Examples

In the examples of .py file, I'll try forcase their main differences, that is between lower and casefold. 
For example, 
      on the first part of the code we can see that both convert the string to lowercase.
      Next, we can see that for special characters the lower case doesn't change the string but
      the casefold changes the character to other small letters. This makes casefold better for
      the case of multilanguage cases.




# STR.SWAPCASE()

As the name basucally implies, it is used to swap the case of the letters is a given word or sentences.




# STR.TITLE()

This is one of the string methods used to change the first letter of every word to capital
letter. As the name implies it is mostly used for writing strings that are used as title.




# STR.UPPER()

This method is used to change every letter of a given string to uppercase.
